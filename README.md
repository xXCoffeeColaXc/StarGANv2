# StarGANv2
 This repository contains an implementation of StarGAN. In this specific implementation, the domains represent different weather conditions. By using StarGAN, we can transform images to visually represent various weather scenarios, such as sunny, rainy, foggy, snowy, etc.

## Application: Weather Domain Translation
Weather plays a critical role in various applications, from autonomous driving to outdoor event planning. By simulating different weather conditions, this implementation of StarGAN can serve as a valuable tool for testing, simulation, and visualization across a wide range of scenarios.

## Getting Started
1. Download dataset from: [link]
2. Run *create_daytime_class.py*
3. Run main.py

## Results
[Optionally, showcase some images generated by your model, comparing source images with their translated versions.]

## Acknowledgements
StarGAN was originally proposed in the paper "StarGAN: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation". We thank the authors for their contributions to the community.
